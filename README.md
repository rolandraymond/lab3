  Sit next to each other (like inline)
  But still accept width, height, padding, and margin (like block)
  
i. What’s the difference between the following display values: inline, block, inline-block?
inline: Items appear next to each other (side by side), but can’t set width or height
block: it takes full width. You can set width and height
inline-block:	it sit next to each other (like inline)
  But still accept width, height, padding, and margin (like block)
